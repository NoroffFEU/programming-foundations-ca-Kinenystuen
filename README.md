# Programming Foundations CA
I chose a slice of bread/sandwich as my object. 
This object has the following properties:
- Type (String), saying that the object is food.
- MaxBites (Number), the maximun bites, in this case 5 bites.
- Bread, topping & butter (Boolean), true or false depending on if its on the plate or not.
- TypeOfTopping (Array of strings), different types of toppin to add to the bread.
- Add bread, add butter, add topping, eatBread (function). When running the add bread function it looks if the plate has a bread on it or not using the bread boolean, if that is false, it will add a bread to the plate. AddButter and addTopping checks if there is bread on the plate or not and other factors. The eatbrad function checks if there is anything to eat and then eat one and one bite each click.
- Bites (array of objects), includes strings(name) and number(biteNumber).
